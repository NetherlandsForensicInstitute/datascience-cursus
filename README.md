# Forensic Data Science: Tutorial Tracks

For the **Cybercrime, Digital Traces and Forensic Data Analysis** course, there are two parallel tutorial tracks available based on your background:

* **Computer Science Track:** For those already familiar with Python. One notebook per lecture is available, focusing on the practical implementation of data science topics. You can find the exercises per week in the [Computer Science Track](computer_science_track) folder.
* **"Learn Python" Track:** For beginners. This track teaches Python basics and covers approximately the same content as the first two notebooks of the CS track. By the end, you should be able to navigate the CS track notebooks at your own pace. You can find the exercises per week in the [Learn Python Track](learn_python_track) folder.
