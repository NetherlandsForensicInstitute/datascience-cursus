This algorithm transforms each high-dimensional sample to a two-dimensional point, in such a way that if two samples are alike, the points are also close together. This can also provide more insight into your data. For now, it is not important that you understand every bit of code. We just want to give you an example of such an algorithm, and show that everybody can apply it.
