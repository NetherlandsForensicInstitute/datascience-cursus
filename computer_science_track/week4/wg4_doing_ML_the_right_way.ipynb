    "So, what can we do about this? Below, we briefly discuss a few ways of working with imbalanced data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Handling imbalanced data on a data-level: For example, oversampling the minority class (e.g. create new entries by duplication) or undersampling the majority class (e.g. remove entries). Be mindful of the shortcomings of those techniques. By undersampling your majority class, valuable information may get lost and by oversampling your minority class, your model might end up 'recognizing' those instances so well that it isn't able to generalize to other instances that also are part of the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Handling imbalanced data on an algorithm-level: Carefully choose the parameters of the model. For example, logistic regression and support vector machine in Python have a parameter called 'class_weight' that you can set to 'balanced'. When you do that, mistakes made in the minority class during training are penalized more than mistakes in the majority class. Therefore, the models put an effort in correctly classifying the minority class.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - Of course, one can always use a combination of the aforementioned approaches. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
